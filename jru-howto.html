Perhaps you find the transport(s) you are currently using too unstable or unreliable. Perhaps you want to use the new ICQv7-t for your ICQ contacts instead of AIM-t. Just migrate your contacts: With Jabber you have full flexibility, you can even use transports set up on servers you do not habe a Jabber account on.

<ol>
<li>Launch you favourite Jabber client</li>
<li>Unregister with the current transport, register with the new transport - remember its name (for example <i>aim.some.jabber.server</i>)<br /><b>Important</b>: This has to be done <i>before</i> importing your contacts in step 9</li>
<li>Fill out the roster utility's "Server information" form field, click "Get roster from Jabber server"</li>
<li>Copy the resulting roster changes to your favourite text editor, delete all contacts that do not have to be changed</li>
<li>Duplicate the remaining contacts and replace all leading "+" by "-" on the <i>original</i> contacts</li>
<li>Replace the old transport's address with the new transport's address on the remaining contacts (the ones starting with "+")</li>
<li>Now you have one block of contacts with a leading "-" (this means all contacts using the old transports are going to be deleted from your roster) and a block with a leading "+" (the contacts using the new transport)</li>
<li>Copy the text back to the roster changes form field</li>
<li>Fill out the roster utility's "Server information" form field, click "Send roster changes to Jabber server"</li>
</ol>
