Jabber roster utility
=====================================
http://jru.jabberstudio.org

Installation
------------

Make sure you have the necessary Perl modules installed (Net::Jabber and
its requirements). You can get them via CPAN ("perl -MCPAN -e shell", 
"install Net::Jabber").

Then just copy the files included to a directory on your web server that 
has ExecCGI rights. Modify config.pl as needed.

It is strongly recommended to provide SSL secured access to the utility's
web pages (https) for the user's Jabber password will be transmitted in
clear text over the wire if using normal http.

Todo
----

- code clean up
- get all imports working again (send in sample contact lists please)

Good luck!
