# Jabber Roster Utility - perl implementation

Jabber Roster Utility (JRU) is web-based tool that helps you to manage your Jabber roster (contact list) - mainly importing contacts from other instant messengers to be used with gateways and moving contacts from one server to another. It used to be quite popular when Jabber started to gain popularity in FLOSS circles in early 2000s.

Please note that I am neither author nor maintainer of that tool. I am merely re-hosting source code due to it's historical notability. If you feel like taking over maintenance, feel free to contact me - I will gladly hand repository over or add pointer to your copy.

This code is also hosted at SourceForge.com: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/jabber-jru/>
